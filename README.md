# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the github flow

Hi! My name is David, and I am a civil engineering master's student graduating December 2025 from the University of Texas at Austin. 
I am currently taking a scientific machine learning class, which is instructing us to host code on github for our final project. 
This class has been an amazing learning experirence because I'm aiming to work at the intersection of civil engineering and AI/data science. 
Stay tuned for more updates!
